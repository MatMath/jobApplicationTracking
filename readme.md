# Jobs tracking

Job application tracking can get tedious with applying on different websites, different company, location, and many recruiters that all propose something... So instead of putting everything in a Excel file I wanted to regroup everything.

### Prerequisites
Install MongoDB Atlas (DB as a service) Or you can also install it locally.

### Getting Started
$ cp config.sample.json config.json
Update the Mongo URL to your config.json
$ npm install
$ npm start
Now the server is running.

## Running the tests
$ npm test

## Todo:
- (See issue)
- Link Cie & Recruteurs to New posting
- Deployment script
- Front-end to retrieve / input data.
- Passport security?

## Deployment
TODO -> CircleCI -> Docker -> AWS ?
